                    <b>Tera Tower Development Inc. (TTDI)</b> and PT Mitra Multi Solusi (PT MMS) have joined forces 
                    for an ambitious project: to establish the most extensive 4G and 5G Telco Smart Tower 
                    network in East Kalimantan, Indonesia's new capital city. This project perfectly aligns with the 
                    rapidly growing data-driven industry, as PT MMS aim to deploy more than 250,000 to 300,000 
                    new Built to Suit (BTS) towers. Our joint efforts aim to digitize the entire Kalimantan region 
                    within the next 3-5 years.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our partnership with PT MMS is built upon a robust business model. We begin by constructing 
                    telecommunication towers and leasing them to local telecom companies, with a 10-year 
                    contract term and a one-year advance rental payment, in line with Indonesian lease terms. 
                    Subsequently, we strategically sell these towers to international corporations, ensuring 
                    substantial returns. This 'Build, Lease, Sell' approach underscores our mutually beneficial 
                    collaboration with PT MMS, contributing to our collective success.
